# Description
 Our safety app, SafeForDU, is designed to enhance security and provide assistance to the 
students at our university. It offers a comprehensive set of features to ensure the safety and well
being of everyone on campus, including emergency alerts, real-time location sharing, and a 
discreet distress signal for immediate assistance.

# User Groups
 The primary user group consists of all students who attend Drake University. However, our app 
could also be utilized by faculty and staff for safety while they are on campus. 

# Tasks                                                                                                      

 1. Alerting Public Safety by pressing a button
 2. Ability to share live location
 3. Reporting crimes
 Our app will provide a wide range of safety services. First, the app 
will have the option to alert public safety immediately with the push 
of a button. Similar to alerting public safety, our app will 
implement a Safe Walk feature that students can use to pair 
themselves with a campus security representative, who will walk 
them to their dormitory or vehicle when it is late at night. In 
addition to physical assistance, the app will have a section to report 
suspicious incidents that have occurred on campus, which will then 
be reviewed and reported to the appropriate authorities. As a stretch 
goal, our app would pair the reporting feature to a map to visually 
display the location of any incidents and increase studentsâ€™ 
awareness of potential threats on campus. The image to the right is 
a mock-up of what we would like the app to look like when completed.

# Problem Scenarios to Address
 1. Limited access to safety resources
 2. Many students who live off-campus or attend evening classes feel unsafe walking home 
or to their vehicle late at night. This app would alleviate these fears. 
3. Some of the features on our app are not currently available or are dispersed across 
various platforms. This app would unify these emergency preparedness necessities and 
cater specifically to Drake students and faculty.
